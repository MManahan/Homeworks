1. There are significantly more Pyber users in the urban city type which makes sense when you think of a city like New York. There are so many taxes and cars on the road and minimal parking for your car, so it is easier and more cost effective to use a car service like Pyber

2. The cost of Pyber rides are much are more spread out in the Rural City Type. I can see that in rural areas, the distances from start point to end point could be much further apart than urban cities. 

3. The amount of drivers in each city type correspond with the amount of rides. There will always be more drivers and activity in the urban areas.
